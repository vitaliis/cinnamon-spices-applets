### Previous versions


These versions were developed using my own github repository at ```https://github.com/pdcurtis``` where full details can still be found. In summary:

 * This applet uses a standard framework I first developed for stopwatch@pdcurtis.

 * The Release candidate was available in December 2013 and relatively little further development was required other than some additional error checking.

 * They were comprehensively tested with Cinnamon 2.4 in Mint 17.1, the last LTS version currently supported.
