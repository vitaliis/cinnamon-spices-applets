### 3.2.1
 * Use CHANGELOG.md instead of changelog.txt in context menu
 * Add symbolic link from UUID folder to applet folder so it is displayed on latest spices web site.
 * Add an initial check that bumblebee daemon is installed.
### 3.2.2
 * Allow GPU temperature to be displayed in vertical panels but shorten (by removing the degree symbol) if over 100 degrees on vertical panels.
 * Update bumblebee.pot to identify changes which need to be translated
