Version   1.3.0
v30_1.0.0 Developed using code from NUMA, Bumblebee and Timer Applets
          Includes changes to work with Mint 18 and Cinnamon 3.0 -gedit -> xed
          Tested with Cinnamon 3.0 in Mint 18 
          TEST CODE IN PLACE namely batteryPercentage divided by 4 to allow testing
          Test Version without call to suspendScript
          Beautified
v30_1.0.1 Code added to ensure valid readings of batteryPercentage
          Code added to 'flash' messages  and extend width with messages but only when discharging.
          Code added to call Suspend script but only when percentage has fallen 
             ie it will be called every 1% fall so it is re-enabled after returning from suspend
          Suspendscript active
          TEST CODE STILL IN PLACE so levels incorrect
v30_1.1.2 Some changes in how test appplied to make it easier to take them out
          Extra flag added for flashing
          Range changed to 10 - 40 for Alert Percentage.
          Tests look good and suspendscript works.
          TEST CODE STILL IN PLACE
          Should I add a forced shutdown if level drops to say 5% because taken out of suspend with
          level dropped too far or suspend cancelled too many times?
v30_1.1.3 Added Modal Dialog triped once at Alert Level and reset by going back above alert level
          Shutdown (Suspend) now at 2/3 of Alert Level.
          Suspend level added to tooltip and left click menu
          TEST CODE REMOVED
v30_1.1.4 Old call removed from batterytempscript.sh which was filling error log
          Error checks on status to ensure valid
          Spelling corrections
